This plugin gives your Wordpress backend a custom favicon.

== Description ==

It creates a link to a shortcut icon, or favicon, into the header of the Wordpress administrative console (and thus into the URL area of your browser). This is very valuable for when you have many tabs open at the same time. 

This plugin creates a new options menu. In the top navigation bar of your administrative console, click on Options. Then, in the submenu that appears, click on Admin Favicon. In the text box labeled Favicon URL, enter the web address of your desired favicon. If you uploaded the sample wpfavicon.ico, enter the location on your server here. Otherwise, use your own favicon

To create your own Favicon you can use one of many free online services. 

NOTE: This adds a favicon to the ADMINISTRATIVE area of your WordPress installation, NOT the front-end theme.

== Installation ==

After downloading adminfavicon.zip, unzip the contents and upload them to your wp-content/plugins Wordpress directory (you do not need to upload wpfavicon.ico). If you wish to use the sample Wordpress favicon provided, upload wpfavicon.ico into the location of your choosing on your server. Then, navigate to the plugins page in the Wordpress administrative console and press Activate.
